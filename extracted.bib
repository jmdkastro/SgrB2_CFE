  abstract =      {We present a theoretical framework in which bound
                   stellar clusters arise naturally at the high-density
                   end of the hierarchy of the interstellar medium
                   (ISM). Due to short free-fall times, these
                   high-density regions achieve high local star
                   formation efficiencies, enabling them to form bound
                   clusters. Star-forming regions of lower density
                   remain substructured and gas-rich, ending up unbound
                   when the residual gas is expelled. Additionally, the
                   tidal perturbation of star-forming regions by nearby,
                   dense giant molecular clouds imposes a minimum
                   density contrast required for the collapse to a bound
                   cluster. The fraction of all star formation that
                   occurs in bound stellar clusters (the cluster
                   formation efficiency, hereafter CFE) follows by
                   integration of these local clustering and survival
                   properties over the full density spectrum of the ISM,
                   and hence is set by galaxy-scale physics. We derive
                   the CFE as a function of observable galaxy
                   properties, and find that it increases with the gas
                   surface density, from Gamma ˜ 1 per cent in
                   low-density galaxies to a peak value of Gamma ˜ 70
                   per cent at densities of Sigmag ˜ 103 M&sun; pc-2.
                   This explains the observation that the CFE increases
                   with the star formation rate density in nearby dwarf,
                   spiral and starburst galaxies. Indeed, comparing our
                   model results with observed galaxies yields excellent
                   agreement. The model is applied further by
                   calculating the spatial variation of the CFE within
                   single galaxies. We also consider the variation of
                   the CFE with cosmic time and show that it increases
                   with redshift, peaking in high-redshift, gas-rich
                   disc galaxies. It is estimated that up to 30-35 per
                   cent of all stars in the Universe once formed in
                   bound stellar clusters. We discuss how our theory can
                   be verified with Gaia and ALMA, and provide possible
                   implementations for theoretical work and for
                   simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

                   feedback represent the main uncertainty in galaxy
                   formation studies. Progress is hampered by the
                   limited empirical constraints outside the restricted
                   environment of the Local Group. In particular, the
                   poorly-quantified time evolution of the molecular
                   cloud lifecycle, star formation, and feedback
                   obstructs robust predictions on the scales smaller
                   than the disc scale height that are resolved in
                   modern galaxy formation simulations. We present a new
                   statistical method to derive the evolutionary
                   timeline of molecular clouds and star-forming
                   regions. By quantifying the excess or deficit of the
                   gas-to-stellar flux ratio around peaks of gas or star
                   formation tracer emission, we directly measure the
                   relative rarity of these peaks, which allows us to
                   derive their lifetimes. We present a step-by-step,
                   quantitative description of the method and
                   demonstrate its practical application. The method's
                   accuracy is tested in nearly 300 experiments using
                   simulated galaxy maps, showing that it is capable of
                   constraining the molecular cloud lifetime and
                   feedback time-scale to $<0.1$ dex precision. Access
                   to the evolutionary timeline provides a variety of
                   additional physical quantities, such as the
                   cloud-scale star formation efficiency, the feedback
                   outflow velocity, the mass loading factor, and the
                   feedback energy or momentum coupling efficiencies to
                   the ambient medium. We show that the results are
                   robust for a wide variety of gas and star formation
                   tracers, spatial resolutions, galaxy inclinations,
                   and galaxy sizes. Finally, we demonstrate that our
                   method can be applied out to high redshift
                   ($z\lesssim4$) with a feasible time investment on
                   current large-scale observatories. This is a major
                   shift from previous studies that constrained the
                   physics of star formation and feedback in the
                   immediate vicinity of the Sun.},

                   covering the disc of the galaxy between radii of 0.45
                   and 4.5 kpc. We aim to probe the properties of the
                   cluster population as a function of distance from the
                   galactic centre. We observe a net decline in cluster
                   formation efficiency (Gamma, i.e. amount of star
                   formation happening in bound clusters) from about 26
                   per cent in the inner region to 8 per cent in the
                   outer part of the galaxy. The recovered Gamma values
                   within different regions of M83 follow the same Gamma
                   versus star formation rate density relation observed
                   for entire galaxies. We also probe the initial
                   cluster mass function (ICMF) as a function of
                   galactocentric distance. We observe a significant
                   steepening of the ICMF in the outer regions (from
                   -1.90 $\pm$ 0.11 to -2.70 $\pm$ 0.14) and for the
                   whole galactic cluster population (slope of -2.18
                   $\pm$ 0.07) of M83. We show that this change of slope
                   reflects a more fundamental change of the `truncation
                   mass' at the high-mass end of the distribution. This
                   can be modelled as a Schechter function of slope -2
                   with an exponential cutoff mass (Mc) that decreases
                   significantly from the inner to the outer regions
                   (from 4.00 to 0.25 × 105 M&sun;) while the galactic
                   Mc is ≈1.60 × 105 M&sun;. The trends in Gamma and
                   ICMF are consistent with the observed radial decrease
                   of the Sigma(H2), hence in gas pressure. As gas
                   pressure declines, cluster formation becomes less
                   efficient. We conclude that the host galaxy
                   environment appears to regulate (1) the fraction of
                   stars locked in clusters and (2) the upper mass limit
                   of the ICMF, consistently described by a
                   near-universal slope -2 truncated at the high-mass
                   end.},

                   ($\Gamma$), the fraction of stellar mass formed in
                   long-lived star clusters. We use robust star
                   formation history and cluster parameter constraints,
                   obtained through color-magnitude diagram analysis of
                   resolved stellar populations, to study Andromeda's
                   cluster and field populations over the last $\sim$300
                   Myr. We measure $\Gamma$ of 4-8% for young, 10-100
                   Myr old populations in M31. We find that cluster
                   formation efficiency varies systematically across the
                   M31 disk, consistent with variations in mid-plane
                   pressure. These $\Gamma$ measurements expand the
                   range of well-studied galactic environments,
                   providing precise constraints in an HI-dominated, low
                   intensity star formation environment. Spatially
                   resolved results from M31 are broadly consistent with
                   previous trends observed on galaxy-integrated scales,
                   where $\Gamma$ increases with increasing star
                   formation rate surface density
                   ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$). However, we can explain
                   observed scatter in the relation and attain better
                   agreement between observations and theoretical models
                   if we account for environmental variations in gas
                   depletion time ($\tau_{\mathrm{dep}}$) when modeling
                   $\Gamma$, accounting for the qualitative shift in
                   star formation behavior when transitioning from a
                   H$_2$-dominated to a HI-dominated interstellar
                   medium. We also demonstrate that $\Gamma$
                   measurements in high $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$
                   starburst systems are well-explained by

                   of young star clusters (YSCs) can vary as a function
                   of the galactic environment in which they are found.
                   We use the cluster catalogue produced by the Legacy
                   Extragalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) collaboration to
                   investigate cluster properties in the spiral galaxy

                   of galactocentric distance and in arm and inter-arm
                   regions. The cluster mass function exhibits a similar
                   shape at all radial bins, described by a power law
                   with a slope close to -2 and an exponential
                   truncation around 105 M&sun;. While the mass
                   functions of the YSCs in the spiral arm and inter-arm
                   regions have similar truncation masses, the inter-arm
                   region mass function has a significantly steeper
                   slope than the one in the arm region; a trend that is
                   also observed in the giant molecular cloud mass
                   function and predicted by simulations. The age
                   distribution of clusters is dependent on the region
                   considered, and is consistent with rapid disruption
                   only in dense regions, while little disruption is
                   observed at large galactocentric distances and in the
                   inter-arm region. The fraction of stars forming in
                   clusters does not show radial variations, despite the
                   drop in the H2 surface density measured as function
                   of galactocentric distance. We suggest that the
                   higher disruption rate observed in the inner part of
                   the galaxy is likely at the origin of the observed
                   flat cluster formation efficiency radial profile.},

                   at 3 mm of the extended Sgr B2 cloud in the Central
                   Molecular Zone (CMZ). We detect 271 compact sources,
                   most of which are smaller than 5000 au. By ruling out
                   alternative possibilities, we conclude that these
                   sources consist of a mix of hypercompact H II regions
                   and young stellar objects (YSOs). Most of the newly
                   detected sources are YSOs with gas envelopes that,
                   based on their luminosities, must contain objects
                   with stellar masses {M}* ≳ 8 {M}o . Their spatial
                   distribution spread over a ~12 × 3 pc region
                   demonstrates that Sgr B2 is experiencing an extended
                   star formation event, not just an isolated
                   ``starburst'' within the protocluster regions. Using
                   this new sample, we examine star formation thresholds
                   and surface density relations in Sgr B2. While all of
                   the YSOs reside in regions of high column density
                   (N({{{H}}}2)≳ 2× {10}23 {{cm}}-2), not all regions
                   of high column density contain YSOs. The observed
                   column density threshold for star formation is
                   substantially higher than that in solar vicinity
                   clouds, implying either that high-mass star formation
                   requires a higher column density or that any star
                   formation threshold in the CMZ must be higher than in

                   formation has been imaged at a wavelength of 1.3 cm
                   with a spatial resolution of ≈2000 AU (0".25) and a
                   sensitivity of ≈0.4 mJy beam-1. These high-quality
                   images show many newly detected continuum components
                   and reveal remarkable features associated with
                   several previously known H II regions. Current models
                   of ultracompact H II regions are discussed within the
                   context of these new data. The images detail 49
                   individual continuum components within the Sgr B2
                   complex. Half of these have diameters less than 5000
                   AU, including several unresolved components
                   (diameters <2100 AU). These H II regions may be
                   explained by a disk photoevaporation model. There are
                   many asymmetrically bright shell-like and arclike H
                   II regions in Sgr B2. The asymmetries observed in the
                   1.3 cm continuum from these shell-like and arclike H
                   II regions correspond to gradients in the 20 cm -->
                   1.3 cm spectral indices, reflecting gradients in the
                   electron densities within many of these H II regions.
                   These shell- and arclike sources may be best
                   described by an "improved" champagne flow model,
                   incorporating stellar winds and significant gradients
                   in the density of ambient neutral material. Numerous
                   filamentary structures are seen in images of the
                   long-tail cometary H II region Sgr B2 I. At least
                   three components are identified in the tail region
                   exhibiting two different position angles on the plane
                   of the sky. The morphology may result from an
                   interaction between the ionized gas of Sgr B2 I and
                   external winds which originate within the nearby Sgr

                   observations of Sgr B2 at the highest possible
                   angular resolution of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
                   Array (VLA). We have observed Sgr B2 Main and North
                   at 42.9 GHz and at 45.4 GHz in the BnA configuration
                   (Main) and the A configuration (North). We compare
                   these new data to archival VLA 7 mm continuum data of
                   Sgr B2 Main observed in 2003 and Sgr B2 North
                   observed in 2001. We find that 1 of the 41 known
                   ultracompact and hypercompact H ii regions in Sgr B2
                   (K2-North) has decreased ~27% in flux density from
                   142 $\pm$ 14 to 103 $\pm$ 10 mJy (2.3sigma) between
                   2001 and 2012. A second source, F3c-Main, has
                   increased ~30% in flux density from 82 $\pm$ 8 to 107
                   $\pm$ 11 mJy (1.8sigma) between 2003 and 2012.
                   F3c-Main was previously observed to increase in flux
                   density at 1.3 cm over a longer time period between
                   1989 and 2012. An observation of decreasing flux
                   density, such as that observed in K2-North, is
                   particularly significant since such a change is not
                   predicted by the classical hypothesis of steady
                   expansion of H ii regions during massive star
                   accretion. Our new observations at 7 mm, along with
                   others in the literature, suggest that the formation
                   of massive stars occurs through time-variable and
                   violent accretion.},

  abstract =      {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not
                   intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a
                   variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic
                   variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions
                   would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In
                   this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is
                   defined, stressing that there is evidence for a
                   change in the power-law index at only two masses:
                   near 0.5Msolar and near 0.08Msolar. Using this
                   supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in
                   any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated
                   by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise
                   and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is
                   found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite
                   well the observed scatter in power-law index
                   determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit
                   within which any true variation becomes undetectable.
                   The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that
                   any true variation of the IMF in well-studied
                   populations must be smaller than this scatter.
                   Determinations of the power-law indices alpha are
                   subject to systematic errors arising mostly from
                   unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is
                   quantified here, with the result that the single-star
                   IMFs for young star clusters are systematically
                   steeper by Deltaalpha~0.5 between 0.1 and 1Msolar
                   than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by,
                   on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in
                   globular clusters appear to be, on average,
                   systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF
                   (Piotto & Zoccali; Paresce & De Marchi), and the
                   recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in
                   the Galactic halo and the absence of associated
                   low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'e}ndez & Minniti)
                   suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient
                   population. Star formation in higher metallicity
                   environments thus appears to produce relatively more
                   low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an
                   interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic
                   variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical
                   arguments.},

                   emission in the high-mass star-forming region
                   Sagittarius B2. Aims: We want to reconstruct the 3D
                   density and dust temperature distribution, as a
                   crucial input to follow-up studies of the gas
                   velocity field and molecular abundances. Methods: We
                   employ the 3D radiative transfer program RADMC-3D to
                   calculate the dust temperature self-consistently,
                   providing a given initial density distribution. This
                   density distribution of the entire cloud complex is
                   then recursively reconstructed, based on available
                   continuum maps, including both single-dish and
                   high-resolution interferometric maps that cover a
                   wide frequency range (nu = 40 GHz-4 THz). The model
                   covers spatial scales from 45 pc down to 100 au,
                   i.e., a spatial dynamic range of 105. Results: We
                   find that the density distribution of Sagittarius B2
                   can be reasonably well fitted by applying a
                   superposition of spherical cores with Plummer-like
                   density profiles. To reproduce the spectral energy
                   distribution, we position Sgr B2(N) along the line of
                   sight behind the plane containing Sgr B2(M). We find
                   that the entire cloud complex comprises a total gas
                   mass of 8.0 × 106 M&sun; within a diameter of 45 pc.
                   This corresponds to an averaged gas density of 170
                   M&sun; pc-3. We estimate stellar masses of 2400
                   M&sun; and 20 700 M&sun; and luminosities of 1.8 ×
                   106 L&sun; and 1.2 × 107 L&sun; for Sgr B2(N) and
                   Sgr B2(M), respectively. We report H2 column
                   densities of 2.9 × 1024 cm-2 for Sgr B2(N) and 2.5
                   × 1024 cm-2 for Sgr B2(M) in a 40'' beam. For Sgr
                   B2(S), we derive a stellar mass of 1100 M&sun;, a
                   luminosity of 6.6 × 105 L&sun;, and an H2 column
                   density of 2.2 × 1024 cm-2 in a 40'' beam. We
                   calculate a star formation efficiency of 5% for Sgr
                   B2(N) and 50% for Sgr B2(M). This indicates that most
                   of the gas content in Sgr B2(M) has already been
                   converted to stars or dispersed.},

  abstract =      {We recently proposed that the star-forming potential
                   of dense molecular clouds in the Central Molecular
                   Zone (CMZ, i.e. the central few 100 pc) of the Milky
                   Way is intimately linked to their orbital dynamics,
                   potentially giving rise to an absolute-time sequence
                   of star-forming clouds. In this paper, we present an
                   orbital model for the gas stream(s) observed in the
                   CMZ. The model is obtained by integrating orbits in
                   the empirically constrained gravitational potential
                   and represents a good fit (chi _red^2=2.0) to the
                   observed position-velocity distribution of dense (n >
                   several 103 cm-3) gas, reproducing all of its key
                   properties. The orbit is also consistent with
                   observational constraints not included in the fitting
                   process, such as the 3D space velocities of Sgr B2
                   and the Arches and Quintuplet clusters. It differs
                   from previous, parametric models in several respects:
                   (1) the orbit is open rather than closed due to the
                   extended mass distribution in the CMZ, (2) its
                   orbital velocity (100-200 km s-1) is twice as high as
                   in previous models, and (3) Sgr A* coincides with the
                   focus of the (eccentric) orbit rather than being
                   offset. Our orbital solution supports the recently
                   proposed scenario in which the dust ridge between
                   G0.253+0.016 (`the Brick') and Sgr B2 represents an
                   absolute-time sequence of star-forming clouds, of
                   which the condensation was triggered by the tidal
                   compression during their most recent pericentre
                   passage. We position the clouds on a common timeline
                   and find that their pericentre passages occurred
                   0.30-0.74 Myr ago. Given their short free-fall times
                   (tff ˜ 0.34 Myr), the quiescent cloud G0.253+0.016
                   and the vigorously star-forming complex Sgr B2 are
                   separated by a single free-fall time of evolution,
                   implying that star formation proceeds rapidly once
                   collapse has been initiated. We provide the complete
                   orbital solution, as well as several quantitative
                   predictions of our model (e.g. proper motions and the
                   positions of star formation `hotspots'). The paper is
                   concluded with a discussion of the assumptions and
                   possible caveats, as well as the position of the
                   model in the Galactic context, highlighting its
                   relation to large-scale gas accretion, the dynamics
                   of the bar, the x2 orbital family, and the origin of

                   unstable, forming dense clumps and filaments. These
                   density perturbations interact with young massive
                   stars, emitting ionizing radiation, alternately
                   exposing and confining their H II regions. As a
                   result, the H II regions are predicted to flicker in
                   flux density over periods of decades to centuries
                   rather than increase monotonically in size as
                   predicted by simple Spitzer solutions. We have
                   recently observed the Sgr B2 region at 1.3 cm with
                   the Very Large Array in its three hybrid
                   configurations (DnC, CnB, and BnA) at a resolution of
                   ~0.''25. These observations were made to compare in
                   detail with matched continuum observations from 1989.
                   At 0.''25 resolution, Sgr B2 contains 41 ultracompact
                   (UC) H II regions, 6 of which are hypercompact. The
                   new observations of Sgr B2 allow comparison of
                   relative peak flux densities for the H II regions in
                   Sgr B2 over a 23 year time baseline (1989-2012) in
                   one of the most source-rich massive star forming
                   regions in the Milky Way. The new 1.3 cm continuum
                   images indicate that four of the 41 UC H II regions
                   exhibit significant changes in their peak flux
                   density, with one source (K3) dropping in peak flux
                   density, and the other three sources (F10.303, F1,
                   and F3) increasing in peak flux density. The results
                   are consistent with statistical predictions from
                   simulations of high mass star formation, suggesting
                   that they offer a solution to the lifetime problem
                   for UC H II regions.},

                   resolution kinematics of the ionized gas associated
                   with the massive stars. Both high spatial resolution
                   and sensitivity to large-scale structures are
                   essential to thoroughly sample the H II regions in
                   Sgr B2 (M) where source sizes of the 36 H II regions
                   range from unresolved (<0".3) to extended (˜10").
                   H66alpha recombination line emission has been
                   detected toward 23 of the 36 continuum sources in Sgr
                   B2 (M). The mean velocity of the detected sources is
                   62$\pm$2 km s-1. He 66alpha line emission is detected
                   toward nine of the 36 continuum sources. The 1.3 cm
                   helium and hydrogen data are used together as a
                   high-resolution probe of Y+ values and variations
                   within Sgr B2 (M). An average singly ionized helium
                   abundance of <Y+> = 10.3%$\pm$1.2% is derived. Of the
                   sources where a Y+ value is determined, only Sgr B2 F
                   has an anomalously low value (Y+ <= 5%). The
                   recombination line data are examined in detail toward
                   several of the most unusual sources. A very broad
                   radio recombination line (DeltaVH66alpha ˜ 64 km
                   s-1, DeltaVH52alpha ˜ 59 km s-1) is measured, and
                   high electron temperatures [Te(H66alpha)* = 26,400 K]
                   are derived for Sgr B2 F. The broad lines and high
                   temperatures may be due to a nonequilibrium
                   environment at the edge of an expanding H II region.
                   Assuming that the F and G H II regions have expanded
                   in a dense molecular environment, they appear to be
                   young, with an average age of <tau> = 0.7$\pm$0.3 x
                   104 yr. This lower limit on the age is consistent
                   with the dynamical age of the nearby massive
                   molecular outflow observed by Lis et al. A doubly
                   peaked H66alpha line has been detected toward the
                   ultracompact H II (UC HII) region Z10.24. This source
                   may be either a very young (tau < 100 yr) shell
                   source or the ionized base of a molecular outflow.
                   The small number of morphological cometary H II
                   regions in Sgr B2 (<5%) and the observed velocity
                   gradients in those regions that do have a cometary
                   morphology indicate that the moving star bow shock
                   model cannot account for any of the H II regions in
                   Sgr B2 (M).},

  abstract =      {The work of Adamo et al. showed that the mass
                   distributions of young massive stellar clusters were
                   truncated above a maximum-mass scale in the nearby
                   galaxy M83 and that this truncation mass varies with
                   the galactocentric radius. Here, we present a
                   cloud-based analysis of Atacama Large
                   Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO(1 --> 0)
                   observations of M83 to search for such a truncation
                   mass in the molecular cloud population. We identify a
                   population of 873 molecular clouds in M83 that is
                   largely similar to those found in the Milky Way and
                   Local Group galaxies, though clouds in the centre of
                   the galaxy show high surface densities and enhanced
                   turbulence, as is common for clouds in high-density
                   nuclear environments. Like the young massive
                   clusters, we find a maximum-mass scale for the
                   molecular clouds which decreases radially in the
                   galaxy. We find that the most young massive cluster
                   tracks the most massive molecular cloud with the
                   cluster mass being 10-2 times that of the most
                   massive molecular cloud. Outside the nuclear region
                   of M83 (Rg > 0.5 kpc), there is no evidence for
                   changing internal conditions in the population of
                   molecular clouds, with the average internal
                   pressures, densities and free-fall times remaining
                   constant for the cloud population over the galaxy.
                   This result is consistent with the bound cluster
                   formation efficiency depending only on the
                   large-scale properties of the interstellar medium
                   rather than the internal conditions of individual
                   clouds.},

                   follow claimed relations between cluster populations
                   and their hosts, such as the fraction of the total
                   luminosity contributed by the clusters as function of
                   the mean star formation rate (SFR) density, the
                   V-band luminosity of the brightest youngest cluster
                   as related to the mean host SFR and the cluster
                   formation efficiency (i.e. the fraction of star
                   formation happening in star clusters) versus the
                   density of the SFR. We find that BCGs follow the
                   trends, supporting a scenario where cluster formation
                   and environmental properties of the host are
                   correlated. They occupy, in all the diagrams, the
                   regions of higher SFRs, as expected by the extreme
                   nature of the starbursts operating in these systems.
                   We find that the star clusters contribute almost to
                   the 20 per cent of the UV luminosity of the hosts. We
                   suggest that the BCG starburst environment has most
                   likely favoured the compression and collapse of the
                   giant molecular clouds, enhancing the local star
                   formation efficiency, so that massive clusters have
                   been formed. The estimated cluster formation
                   efficiency supports this scenario. BCGs have a
                   cluster formation efficiency comparable to luminous
                   IR galaxies and spiral starburst nuclei (the averaged
                   value is ˜35 per cent) which is much higher than the
                   8-10 per cent reported for quiescent spirals and
                   dwarf star-forming galaxies.},

                   cosmic ray ionization rate orders of magnitude higher
                   than the disc; akin to the environment found in
                   star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Previous
                   studies have shown that this region is forming stars
                   at a rate per unit mass of dense gas which is at
                   least an order of magnitude lower than in the disc,
                   potentially violating theoretical predictions. We
                   show that all observational star formation rate
                   diagnostics - both direct counting of young stellar
                   objects and integrated light measurements - are in
                   agreement within a factor two, hence the low star
                   formation rate (SFR) is not the result of the
                   systematic uncertainties that affect any one method.
                   As these methods trace the star formation over
                   different time-scales, from 0.1 to 5 Myr, we conclude
                   that the SFR has been constant to within a factor of
                   a few within this time period. We investigate the
                   progression of star formation within gravitationally
                   bound clouds on ~parsec scales and find 1-4 per cent
                   of the cloud masses are converted into stars per
                   free-fall time, consistent with a subset of the
                   considered 'volumetric' star formation models.
                   However, discriminating between these models is
                   obstructed by the current uncertainties on the input
                   observables and, most importantly and urgently, by
                   their dependence on ill-constrained free parameters.
                   The lack of empirical constraints on these parameters
                   therefore represents a key challenge in the further
                   verification or falsification of current star
                   formation theories.},

                   and the sonic scale {lambda }{sonic}=0.15+/- 0.11
                   {pc} of the turbulence, and find {W}{fil}≈ {lambda
                   }{sonic}. A strong velocity gradient is seen in the
                   HNCO intensity-weighted velocity maps obtained with
                   ALMA+Mopra. The gradient is likely caused by
                   large-scale shearing of G0.253+0.016, producing a
                   wide double-peaked velocity probability distribution
                   function (PDF). After subtracting the gradient to
                   isolate the turbulent motions, we find a nearly
                   Gaussian velocity PDF typical for turbulence. We
                   measure the total and turbulent velocity dispersion,
                   8.8+/- 0.2 {km} {{{s}}}-1 and 3.9+/- 0.1 {km}
                   {{{s}}}-1, respectively. Using magnetohydrodynamical
                   turbulence simulations, we find that G0.253+0.016's
                   turbulent magnetic field {B}{turb}=130+/- 50 mu {{G}}
                   is only ≲ 1/10 of the ordered field component.
                   Combining these measurements, we reconstruct the
                   dominant turbulence driving mode in G0.253+0.016 and
                   find a driving parameter of b=0.22+/- 0.12,
                   indicating solenoidal (divergence-free) driving. We
                   compare this to spiral-arm clouds, which typically
                   have a significant compressive (curl-free) driving
                   component (b\gt 0.4). Motivated by previous reports
                   of strong shearing motions in the CMZ, we speculate
                   that shear causes the solenoidal driving in
                   G0.253+0.016 and show that this reduces the
                   star-formation rate by a factor of 6.9 compared to
                   typical nearby clouds.},

  abstract =      {Context. The Galactic center is the closest region
                   where we can study star formation under extreme
                   physical conditions like those in high-redshift
                   galaxies. Aims: We measure the temperature of the
                   dense gas in the central molecular zone (CMZ) and
                   examine what drives it. Methods: We mapped the inner
                   300 pc of the CMZ in the temperature-sensitive J =
                   3-2 para-formaldehyde (p - H2CO) transitions. We used
                   the 32,1-22,0/ 30,3-20,2 line ratio to determine the
                   gas temperature in n ~ 104-105 cm-3 gas. We have
                   produced temperature maps and cubes with 30'' and 1
                   km s-1 resolution and published all data in FITS
                   form. Results: Dense gas temperatures in the Galactic
                   center range from ~60 K to >100 K in selected
                   regions. The highest gas temperatures TG> 100 K are
                   observed around the Sgr B2 cores, in the extended Sgr
                   B2 cloud, the 20 km s-1 and 50 km s-1 clouds, and in
                   "The Brick" (G0.253+0.016). We infer an upper limit
                   on the cosmic ray ionization rate zetaCR< 10-14s-1.
                   Conclusions: The dense molecular gas temperature of
                   the region around our Galactic center is similar to
                   values found in the central regions of other
                   galaxies, in particular starburst systems. The gas
                   temperature is uniformly higher than the dust
                   temperature, confirming that dust is a coolant in the
                   dense gas. Turbulent heating can readily explain the
                   observed temperatures given the observed line widths.
                   Cosmic rays cannot explain the observed variation in
                   gas temperatures, so CMZ dense gas temperatures are
                   not dominated by cosmic ray heating. The gas
                   temperatures previously observed to be high in the
                   inner ~75 pc are confirmed to be high in the entire
                   CMZ. The data can be accessed from

                   (CMZ) may be intimately linked to the orbital
                   dynamics of the gas. Recent models suggest that star
                   formation within the dust ridge molecular clouds
                   (from G0.253+0.016 to Sgr B2) follows an evolutionary
                   time sequence, triggered by tidal compression during
                   their preceding pericentre passage. Given that these
                   clouds are the most likely precursors to a generation
                   of massive stars and extreme star clusters, this
                   scenario would have profound implications for
                   constraining the time-evolution of star formation. In
                   this Letter, we search for the initial conditions of
                   the protocluster clouds, focusing on the kinematics
                   of gas situated upstream from pericentre. We observe
                   a highly regular corrugated velocity field in {l,
                   vLSR} space, with amplitude and wavelength A = 3.7
                   $\pm$ 0.1 km s-1 and lambdavel,I = 22.5 $\pm$ 0.1 pc,
                   respectively. The extremes in velocity correlate with
                   a series of massive (˜104 M&sun;) and compact (Req
                   ˜ 2 pc), quasi-regularly spaced (˜8 pc), molecular
                   clouds. The corrugation wavelength and cloud
                   separation closely agree with the predicted Toomre
                   (˜17 pc) and Jeans (˜6 pc) lengths, respectively.
                   We conclude that gravitational instabilities are
                   driving the condensation of molecular clouds within
                   the Galactic Centre gas stream. Furthermore, we
                   speculate these seeds are the historical analogue of
                   the dust-ridge molecular clouds, representing the
                   initial conditions of star and cluster formation in
                   the CMZ.},

                   Sgr B2. We focus on the hyperfine structure of the
                   metastable ammonia inversion lines (J, K) = (1,
                   1)-(6, 6) to derive column density, kinematics,
                   opacity, and kinetic gas temperature. In the CMZ
                   molecular clouds, we find typical line widths of 8-16
                   km s-1 and extended regions of optically thick (tau >

                   are detected at 25-50 K and 60-100 K, both being
                   significantly hotter than the dust temperatures
                   throughout the CMZ. We discuss the physical state of
                   the CMZ gas as traced by ammonia in the context of
                   the orbital model by Kruijssen et al. that interprets
                   the observed distribution as a stream of molecular
                   clouds following an open eccentric orbit. This allows
                   us to statistically investigate the time dependencies
                   of gas temperature, column density, and line width.
                   We find heating rates between ˜50 and ˜100 K Myr-1
                   along the stream orbit. No strong signs of time
                   dependence are found for column density or line
                   width. These quantities are likely dominated by
                   cloud-to-cloud variations. Our results qualitatively
                   match the predictions of the current model of tidal

                   Galaxy and derive the large-scale distribution of
                   stars and interstellar matter in the Nuclear Bulge.
                   Models of the Galactic Disk and Bulge are developed
                   in order to correctly decompose the total surface
                   brightness maps of the inner Galaxy and to apply
                   proper extinction corrections. The Nuclear Bulge
                   appears as a distinct, massive disk-like complex of
                   stars and molecular clouds which is, on a large
                   scale, symmetric with respect to the Galactic Centre.
                   It is distinguished from the Galactic Bulge by its
                   flat disk-like morphology, very high density of stars
                   and molecular gas, and ongoing star formation. The
                   Nuclear Bulge consists of an R-2 Nuclear Stellar
                   Cluster at the centre, a large Nuclear Stellar Disk
                   with radius 230+/-20 pc and scale height 45+/- 5 pc,
                   and the Nuclear Molecular Disk of same size. The
                   total stellar mass and luminosity of the Nuclear
                   Bulge are 1.4+/-0.6x 109 Msun and 2.5+/-1x 109 Lsun,
                   respectively. About 70% of the luminosity is due to
                   optical and UV radiation from young massive
                   Main-Sequence stars which are most abundant in the
                   Nuclear Stellar Cluster. For the first time, we
                   derive a photometric mass distribution for the
                   central 500 pc of the Galaxy which is fully
                   consistent with the kinematic mass distribution. We
                   find that the often cited R-2 distribution holds only
                   for the central ~ 30 pc and that at larger radii the
                   mass distribution is dominated by the Nuclear Stellar
                   Disk which has a flatter density profile. The total
                   interstellar hydrogen mass in the Nuclear Bulge is
                   MH=2+/-0.3x 107 Msun, distributed in a warm inner
                   disk with R=110+/-20 pc and a massive, cold outer
                   torus which contains more than 80% of this mass.
                   Interstellar matter in the Nuclear Bulge is very
                   clumpy with ~ 90% of the mass contained in dense and
                   massive molecular clouds with a volume filling factor
                   of only a few per cent. This extreme clumpiness,
                   probably caused by the tidal stability limit in the
                   gravitational potential of the Nuclear Bulge, enables
                   the strong interstellar radiation field to penetrate
                   the entire Nuclear Bulge and explains the relatively
                   low average extinction towards the Galactic Centre.
                   In addition, we find 3x 107 Msun of cold and dense
                   material outside the Nuclear Bulge at positive
                   longitudes and 1x 107 Msun at negative longitudes.
                   This material is not heated by the stars in the
                   Nuclear Bulge and gives rise to the observed
                   asymmetry in the distribution of interstellar matter
                   in the Central Molecular Zone.},

                   known to form from the gravitational collapse of
                   dense clumps in interstellar molecular clouds, and it
                   has been proposed that the resulting star formation

                   Milky Way Galaxy's disc as well as in distant
                   galaxies where the star formation rates are often
                   much larger. The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, the
                   Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), contains the largest
                   concentration of dense, high-surface density
                   molecular gas in the Milky Way, providing an
                   environment where the validity of star formation
                   prescriptions can be tested. Here, we show that by
                   several measures, the current star formation rate in
                   the CMZ is an order-of-magnitude lower than the rates
                   predicted by the currently accepted prescriptions. In
                   particular, the region 1$\,^{\circ}$ < l <
                   3$\,^{\circ}$.5, |b| < 0$\,^{\circ}$.5 contains ˜107
                   M&sun; of dense (> several 103 cm-3) molecular gas -
                   enough to form 1000 Orion-like clusters - but the
                   present-day star formation rate within this gas is
                   only equivalent to that in Orion. In addition to
                   density, another property of molecular clouds must be
                   included in the star formation prescription to
                   predict the star formation rate in a given mass of
                   molecular gas. We discuss which physical mechanisms
                   might be responsible for suppressing star formation
                   in the CMZ.},

  abstract =      {Whilst young massive clusters (YMCs; M ≳ 104
                   M&sun;, age ≲ 100 Myr) have been identified in
                   significant numbers, their progenitor gas clouds have
                   eluded detection. Recently, four extreme molecular
                   clouds residing within 200 pc of the Galactic Centre
                   have been identified as having the properties thought
                   necessary to form YMCs. Here, we utilize far-IR
                   continuum data from the Herschel infrared Galactic
                   Plane Survey (HiGAL) and millimetre spectral line
                   data from the Millimetre Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz
                   Survey to determine their global physical and
                   kinematic structure. We derive their masses, dust
                   temperatures and radii and use virial analysis to
                   conclude that they are all likely gravitationally
                   bound - confirming that they are likely YMC
                   progenitors. We then compare the density profiles of
                   these clouds to those of the gas and stellar
                   components of the Sagittarius B2 Main and North
                   protoclusters and the stellar distribution of the
                   Arches YMC. We find that even in these clouds - the
                   most massive and dense quiescent clouds in the Galaxy
                   - the gas is not compact enough to form an
                   Arches-like (M = 2 × 104 M&sun;, Reff = 0.4 pc)
                   stellar distribution. Further dynamical processes
                   would be required to condense the resultant
                   population, indicating that the mass becomes more
                   centrally concentrated as the (proto)cluster evolves.
                   These results suggest that YMC formation may proceed
                   hierarchically rather than through monolithic
                   collapse.},
