  abstract =      {We present a theoretical framework in which bound
                   stellar clusters arise naturally at the high-density
                   end of the hierarchy of the interstellar medium
                   (ISM). Due to short free-fall times, these
                   high-density regions achieve high local star
                   formation efficiencies, enabling them to form bound
                   clusters. Star-forming regions of lower density
                   remain substructured and gas-rich, ending up unbound
                   when the residual gas is expelled. Additionally, the
                   tidal perturbation of star-forming regions by nearby,
                   dense giant molecular clouds imposes a minimum
                   density contrast required for the collapse to a bound
                   cluster. The fraction of all star formation that
                   occurs in bound stellar clusters (the cluster
                   formation efficiency, hereafter CFE) follows by
                   integration of these local clustering and survival
                   properties over the full density spectrum of the ISM,
                   and hence is set by galaxy-scale physics. We derive
                   the CFE as a function of observable galaxy
                   properties, and find that it increases with the gas
                   surface density, from Gamma ˜ 1 per cent in
                   low-density galaxies to a peak value of Gamma ˜ 70
                   per cent at densities of Sigmag ˜ 103 M&sun; pc-2.
                   This explains the observation that the CFE increases
                   with the star formation rate density in nearby dwarf,
                   spiral and starburst galaxies. Indeed, comparing our
                   model results with observed galaxies yields excellent
                   agreement. The model is applied further by
                   calculating the spatial variation of the CFE within
                   single galaxies. We also consider the variation of
                   the CFE with cosmic time and show that it increases
                   with redshift, peaking in high-redshift, gas-rich
                   disc galaxies. It is estimated that up to 30-35 per
                   cent of all stars in the Universe once formed in
                   bound stellar clusters. We discuss how our theory can
                   be verified with Gaia and ALMA, and provide possible
                   implementations for theoretical work and for
                   simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

                   at 3 mm of the extended Sgr B2 cloud in the Central
                   Molecular Zone (CMZ). We detect 271 compact sources,
                   most of which are smaller than 5000 au. By ruling out
                   alternative possibilities, we conclude that these
                   sources consist of a mix of hypercompact H II regions
                   and young stellar objects (YSOs). Most of the newly
                   detected sources are YSOs with gas envelopes that,
                   based on their luminosities, must contain objects
                   with stellar masses {M}* ≳ 8 {M}o . Their spatial
                   distribution spread over a ~12 × 3 pc region
                   demonstrates that Sgr B2 is experiencing an extended
                   star formation event, not just an isolated
                   ``starburst'' within the protocluster regions. Using
                   this new sample, we examine star formation thresholds
                   and surface density relations in Sgr B2. While all of
                   the YSOs reside in regions of high column density
                   (N({{{H}}}2)≳ 2× {10}23 {{cm}}-2), not all regions
                   of high column density contain YSOs. The observed
                   column density threshold for star formation is
                   substantially higher than that in solar vicinity
                   clouds, implying either that high-mass star formation
                   requires a higher column density or that any star
                   formation threshold in the CMZ must be higher than in
                   nearby clouds. The relation between the surface
                   density of gas and stars is incompatible with
                   extrapolations from local clouds, and instead stellar
                   densities in Sgr B2 follow a linear {{{Sigma }}}*
                   {--}{{{Sigma }}}{gas} relation, shallower than that
                   observed in local clouds. Together, these points
                   suggest that a higher volume density threshold is
                   required to explain star formation in CMZ clouds.},

  abstract =      {The radio continuum toward the Sgr B2 region of star
                   formation has been imaged at a wavelength of 1.3 cm
                   with a spatial resolution of ≈2000 AU (0".25) and a
                   sensitivity of ≈0.4 mJy beam-1. These high-quality
                   images show many newly detected continuum components
                   and reveal remarkable features associated with
                   several previously known H II regions. Current models
                   of ultracompact H II regions are discussed within the
                   context of these new data. The images detail 49
                   individual continuum components within the Sgr B2
                   complex. Half of these have diameters less than 5000
                   AU, including several unresolved components
                   (diameters <2100 AU). These H II regions may be
                   explained by a disk photoevaporation model. There are
                   many asymmetrically bright shell-like and arclike H
                   II regions in Sgr B2. The asymmetries observed in the
                   1.3 cm continuum from these shell-like and arclike H
                   II regions correspond to gradients in the 20 cm -->
                   1.3 cm spectral indices, reflecting gradients in the
                   electron densities within many of these H II regions.
                   These shell- and arclike sources may be best
                   described by an "improved" champagne flow model,
                   incorporating stellar winds and significant gradients
                   in the density of ambient neutral material. Numerous
                   filamentary structures are seen in images of the
                   long-tail cometary H II region Sgr B2 I. At least
                   three components are identified in the tail region
                   exhibiting two different position angles on the plane
                   of the sky. The morphology may result from an
                   interaction between the ionized gas of Sgr B2 I and
                   external winds which originate within the nearby Sgr
                   B2 F cluster of H II regions.},

                   observations of Sgr B2 at the highest possible
                   angular resolution of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
                   Array (VLA). We have observed Sgr B2 Main and North
                   at 42.9 GHz and at 45.4 GHz in the BnA configuration
                   (Main) and the A configuration (North). We compare
                   these new data to archival VLA 7 mm continuum data of
                   Sgr B2 Main observed in 2003 and Sgr B2 North
                   observed in 2001. We find that 1 of the 41 known
                   ultracompact and hypercompact H ii regions in Sgr B2
                   (K2-North) has decreased ~27% in flux density from
                   142 $\pm$ 14 to 103 $\pm$ 10 mJy (2.3sigma) between
                   2001 and 2012. A second source, F3c-Main, has
                   increased ~30% in flux density from 82 $\pm$ 8 to 107
                   $\pm$ 11 mJy (1.8sigma) between 2003 and 2012.
                   F3c-Main was previously observed to increase in flux
                   density at 1.3 cm over a longer time period between
                   1989 and 2012. An observation of decreasing flux
                   density, such as that observed in K2-North, is
                   particularly significant since such a change is not
                   predicted by the classical hypothesis of steady
                   expansion of H ii regions during massive star
                   accretion. Our new observations at 7 mm, along with
                   others in the literature, suggest that the formation
                   of massive stars occurs through time-variable and

                   emission in the high-mass star-forming region
                   Sagittarius B2. Aims: We want to reconstruct the 3D
                   density and dust temperature distribution, as a
                   crucial input to follow-up studies of the gas
                   velocity field and molecular abundances. Methods: We
                   employ the 3D radiative transfer program RADMC-3D to
                   calculate the dust temperature self-consistently,
                   providing a given initial density distribution. This
                   density distribution of the entire cloud complex is
                   then recursively reconstructed, based on available
                   continuum maps, including both single-dish and
                   high-resolution interferometric maps that cover a
                   wide frequency range (nu = 40 GHz-4 THz). The model
                   covers spatial scales from 45 pc down to 100 au,
                   i.e., a spatial dynamic range of 105. Results: We
                   find that the density distribution of Sagittarius B2
                   can be reasonably well fitted by applying a
                   superposition of spherical cores with Plummer-like
                   density profiles. To reproduce the spectral energy
                   distribution, we position Sgr B2(N) along the line of
                   sight behind the plane containing Sgr B2(M). We find
                   that the entire cloud complex comprises a total gas
                   mass of 8.0 × 106 M&sun; within a diameter of 45 pc.
                   This corresponds to an averaged gas density of 170
                   M&sun; pc-3. We estimate stellar masses of 2400
                   M&sun; and 20 700 M&sun; and luminosities of 1.8 ×
                   106 L&sun; and 1.2 × 107 L&sun; for Sgr B2(N) and
                   Sgr B2(M), respectively. We report H2 column
                   densities of 2.9 × 1024 cm-2 for Sgr B2(N) and 2.5
                   × 1024 cm-2 for Sgr B2(M) in a 40'' beam. For Sgr
                   B2(S), we derive a stellar mass of 1100 M&sun;, a
                   luminosity of 6.6 × 105 L&sun;, and an H2 column
                   density of 2.2 × 1024 cm-2 in a 40'' beam. We
                   calculate a star formation efficiency of 5% for Sgr
                   B2(N) and 50% for Sgr B2(M). This indicates that most
                   of the gas content in Sgr B2(M) has already been
                   converted to stars or dispersed.},

                   Zone (CMZ, i.e. the central few 100 pc) of the Milky
                   Way is intimately linked to their orbital dynamics,
                   potentially giving rise to an absolute-time sequence
                   of star-forming clouds. In this paper, we present an
                   orbital model for the gas stream(s) observed in the
                   CMZ. The model is obtained by integrating orbits in
                   the empirically constrained gravitational potential
                   and represents a good fit (chi _red^2=2.0) to the
                   observed position-velocity distribution of dense (n >
                   several 103 cm-3) gas, reproducing all of its key
                   properties. The orbit is also consistent with
                   observational constraints not included in the fitting
                   process, such as the 3D space velocities of Sgr B2
                   and the Arches and Quintuplet clusters. It differs
                   from previous, parametric models in several respects:
                   (1) the orbit is open rather than closed due to the
                   extended mass distribution in the CMZ, (2) its
                   orbital velocity (100-200 km s-1) is twice as high as
                   in previous models, and (3) Sgr A* coincides with the
                   focus of the (eccentric) orbit rather than being
                   offset. Our orbital solution supports the recently
                   proposed scenario in which the dust ridge between
                   G0.253+0.016 (`the Brick') and Sgr B2 represents an
                   absolute-time sequence of star-forming clouds, of
                   which the condensation was triggered by the tidal
                   compression during their most recent pericentre
                   passage. We position the clouds on a common timeline
                   and find that their pericentre passages occurred
                   0.30-0.74 Myr ago. Given their short free-fall times
                   (tff ˜ 0.34 Myr), the quiescent cloud G0.253+0.016
                   and the vigorously star-forming complex Sgr B2 are
                   separated by a single free-fall time of evolution,
                   implying that star formation proceeds rapidly once
                   collapse has been initiated. We provide the complete
                   orbital solution, as well as several quantitative
                   predictions of our model (e.g. proper motions and the
                   positions of star formation `hotspots'). The paper is
                   concluded with a discussion of the assumptions and
                   possible caveats, as well as the position of the
                   model in the Galactic context, highlighting its
                   relation to large-scale gas accretion, the dynamics
                   of the bar, the x2 orbital family, and the origin of
                   the Arches and Quintuplet clusters.},

                   so quickly that they are themselves gravitationally
                   unstable, forming dense clumps and filaments. These
                   density perturbations interact with young massive
                   stars, emitting ionizing radiation, alternately
                   exposing and confining their H II regions. As a
                   result, the H II regions are predicted to flicker in
                   flux density over periods of decades to centuries
                   rather than increase monotonically in size as
                   predicted by simple Spitzer solutions. We have
                   recently observed the Sgr B2 region at 1.3 cm with
                   the Very Large Array in its three hybrid
                   configurations (DnC, CnB, and BnA) at a resolution of
                   ~0.''25. These observations were made to compare in
                   detail with matched continuum observations from 1989.
                   At 0.''25 resolution, Sgr B2 contains 41 ultracompact
                   (UC) H II regions, 6 of which are hypercompact. The
                   new observations of Sgr B2 allow comparison of
                   relative peak flux densities for the H II regions in
                   Sgr B2 over a 23 year time baseline (1989-2012) in
                   one of the most source-rich massive star forming
                   regions in the Milky Way. The new 1.3 cm continuum
                   images indicate that four of the 41 UC H II regions
                   exhibit significant changes in their peak flux
                   density, with one source (K3) dropping in peak flux
                   density, and the other three sources (F10.303, F1,
                   and F3) increasing in peak flux density. The results
                   are consistent with statistical predictions from
                   simulations of high mass star formation, suggesting
                   that they offer a solution to the lifetime problem
                   for UC H II regions.},

                   distance of 8500 pc, this spatial resolution
                   corresponds to a physical scale of 0.005 pc (~1100

                   emission in 12 individual ultracompact and
                   hypercompact H II regions. Two of the sources with

                   broadening can account for the broad lines in some of
                   the sources, but that gas motions (e.g., turbulence,
                   accretion, or outflow) contribute significantly to
                   the broad lines in at least one of the sources (Sgr

                   Large Array in the continuum (7 mm and 1.3 cm) and in
                   the radio recombination lines H52alpha, H66alpha, and
                   He 66alpha. The H66alpha(˜0".25 resolution) and
                   H52alpha(˜2".5 resolution) data provide high spatial
                   resolution kinematics of the ionized gas associated
                   with the massive stars. Both high spatial resolution
                   and sensitivity to large-scale structures are
                   essential to thoroughly sample the H II regions in
                   Sgr B2 (M) where source sizes of the 36 H II regions
                   range from unresolved (<0".3) to extended (˜10").
                   H66alpha recombination line emission has been
                   detected toward 23 of the 36 continuum sources in Sgr
                   B2 (M). The mean velocity of the detected sources is
                   62$\pm$2 km s-1. He 66alpha line emission is detected
                   toward nine of the 36 continuum sources. The 1.3 cm
                   helium and hydrogen data are used together as a
                   high-resolution probe of Y+ values and variations
                   within Sgr B2 (M). An average singly ionized helium
                   abundance of <Y+> = 10.3%$\pm$1.2% is derived. Of the
                   sources where a Y+ value is determined, only Sgr B2 F
                   has an anomalously low value (Y+ <= 5%). The
                   recombination line data are examined in detail toward
                   several of the most unusual sources. A very broad
                   radio recombination line (DeltaVH66alpha ˜ 64 km
                   s-1, DeltaVH52alpha ˜ 59 km s-1) is measured, and
                   high electron temperatures [Te(H66alpha)* = 26,400 K]
                   are derived for Sgr B2 F. The broad lines and high
                   temperatures may be due to a nonequilibrium
                   environment at the edge of an expanding H II region.
                   Assuming that the F and G H II regions have expanded
                   in a dense molecular environment, they appear to be
                   young, with an average age of <tau> = 0.7$\pm$0.3 x
                   104 yr. This lower limit on the age is consistent
                   with the dynamical age of the nearby massive
                   molecular outflow observed by Lis et al. A doubly
                   peaked H66alpha line has been detected toward the
                   ultracompact H II (UC HII) region Z10.24. This source
                   may be either a very young (tau < 100 yr) shell
                   source or the ionized base of a molecular outflow.
                   The small number of morphological cometary H II
                   regions in Sgr B2 (<5%) and the observed velocity
                   gradients in those regions that do have a cometary
                   morphology indicate that the moving star bow shock
                   model cannot account for any of the H II regions in
                   Sgr B2 (M).},
